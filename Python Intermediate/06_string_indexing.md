indexing = accessing elements of a sequence using `[]` (indexing operator)
```
credit_number = "1234-5678-9012"
print(credit_number[0])
print(credit_number[0:4])
print(credit_number[5:])
print(credit_number[-1])
```
- step-
  ```
  credit_number = "1234-5678-9012"
  print(credit_number[::2])
  ```
  It only print places which are multiple of 2
- end -
  ```
  credit_number = "1234-5678-9012"
  last_digits = credits_number[-4:]
  print(f"xxxx-xxxx-{last_digits}")
- reversing the string -
  ```
  credit_number = "1234-5678-9012"
  credit_number = credit_number[::-1}
  print(credit_number)
  ```
  (setting steps to -1 )
- format specifiers - {value:flag} format a value based on what flaga are inserted
