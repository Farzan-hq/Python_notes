## The while Loop
With the `while` loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

```
i = 1  
while i < 6:  
  print(i)  
  i += 1  
```

- With the `continue` statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next **( skipping)**
- With the `else` statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true
