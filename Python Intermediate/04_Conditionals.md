- `if` = Do some code only if some condition is true
- `else` do something else
- ```
  if b > a:
  ```
  this is an if syntax (above)
- If statement, without indentation (will raise an error)
- The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition"
- if `if` if true - every other code under `if` would be skipped


  
conditional expression (ternary operator)
- print or assign one or two values based on a condition , X if condition else Y
- ( one line shortcut for the if else statement
```
num = 5
print("Positive" if num > 0 else "Negative")
```
